Arduino Solar project: 
Website: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/FIELDING/solar-panel-sun-tracker-phone-charger-f669ce?ref=tag&ref_id=solar&offset=1
Objective:
1)	Making use of two servo motors to produce rotation with respect to x and y axis using wooden frame only
2)	Produce enough voltage for my S20 cell phone to charge

To-do: 
1)	Investigate:
a. Principle of phone charging:

b. DC-DC boost converter
S20 battery specification: https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s20-10081.php
Specification: According to my travel adapter, the input in 100-240V, 50-60Hz 0.7A
Output(PDO) 5.0V 3.0A 15.0W, or 9.0v 2.77A 25.0W, or (PPS) 3.3 TO 5.9V, 3.0A or 3.3-11.0V, 2.25 A(7.5 - 25.0W)
3)	Designing a circuit diagram for the whole set up(two LDRs for one direction only, two 10 kohm resistors, solar panels, DC-DC boost converter)
4)	anything you want to add

First zoom meeting:
Two-days later: 03/03, 9pm?
Objective of the meeting:
a. Discuss to do one final product or 4 products for each individuals?
   If individual, then buy the arduino board
b. circuit design discussion
c. designing of the frame(how to use 3d-printer to do)
d. Division of labour: Temporary : EE student: Check and design circuits, Samuel: 3D-printer, Tony: Preparation for the ingredients(resistors, photoresistors)
